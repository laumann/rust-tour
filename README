Rust tour
=========

This is my Rust tour, written because I think the chosen approach in the various
Rust documentation efforts is much too convoluted and overwhelming for
new-comers (even experienced programmers).

I take a lesson from the "Go tour":

 - The introduction is one big interactive slide show
 - It _is_ sectioned, but not visibly (only major section headers)
 - Only the necessary bits are introduced at a time, convenience can come later.



hello.rs
--------
For example, why does the introductory piece of Rust code contain macros? Given
they are somewhat different from C macros and all require the st*p*d !-symbol,
they add more complexity to the beginner than necesary. Compare

use std::io;
fn main() {
	io::println("Hello, World");
}

with

fn main() {
	println!("Hello, World");
}

EVERYONE has heard of a module system, but NOT everyone has heard of the
!-macros. Save them for later.
